# VPS-automation_racknap
This was project taken up with an Akamai Partner where we integrated Linode APIs to the partners hosting platform- RACKNAP. This automation would serve as a one click deployment of servers from the partners website. This was done to enable our hosting partners to reach out to their exisitng VPS hosting customer to use Linode as an one-click deployment option.
